* Add support for additional request parameters in `CustomerSession.listPaymentMethods`

### Breaking changes

This update removes many utility methods that were public, but not strictly related to Stripe or this library.
In most cases this will not affect you, but if you relied on any of the removed methods I recommend you copy the methods
into your project, or find other replacements.

* Removed many unused and unnecessary methods and constants on `StripeCard`
* Removed file `card_utils.dart` and all it's contents.

## 3.2.0

* Add new method: `StripeApi.createSource()`

## 3.1.0

* `CustomerSession` now implements `ChangeNotifier`, notifying listeners when the session is ended.
* `CustomerSession` will throw an error if attempted used after the session has ended.
* Added `CustomerSession.endSession()` instance method.
* `PaymentMethodStore` will now be cleared, listeners notified and finally disposed when the related `CustomerSession` is ended.
